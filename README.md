# HFoss-Final
**Team :** Jacob Westerback, Brian Sandon, Megan Smith

**Description**

Fractionator will be a game for fourth graders focusing on the topic of Number and Operations — Fractions: Teaching the extended understanding of fraction equivalence and ordering. Students will be asked to place visualizations of fractions in the correct order.

**Project Folder**
The project folder "Fractionator" can be found in the "activities" folder. It will be the only folder that our team will code in.

## The Game : Fractionator
**Team** : Jacob Westerback, Brian Sandon, Megan Smith

#### Short Description
Fractionator will be a game for fourth graders focusing on the topic of Number and Operations — Fractions: Teaching the extended understanding of fraction equivalence and ordering. Students will be asked to place visualizations of fractions in the correct order.

### Goals
* Moveable Fraction “Cards”
	* Fraction Number Cards
	* Pie Chart Cards
	* Combo mode
* Difficulty Settings
	* Changes the amount of cards generated
* Replay Button
* Attractive visual design
* Follow good code practices
* Presentation
	* Make your slides web-accessible
	* Speak for a roughly equal amount of the presentation.
	* Demonstrate
	* Questions
		* What are some of the best pieces of software you wrote? Why?
		* What are some of the worst pieces? Why?
		* What stumbling blocks were there? What successes?
		* What would you have done differently?
		* What would you have worked on if you'd had more time?

#### Stretch Goals
* Multiple Mode
	* Matching Pie Visualization to Numeric Visualization to Decimal Visualization
* Timed Mode
	* Function Similar as a test

### Specs
* Build and Run for [XO](http://laptop.org/en/laptop/index.shtml)
* Post on [wiki](http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Math4Team/RIT/Projects)
* licensed under an OSI-compatible license
* ensure source repository contain clear written instructions for future developers
* Post Mortem
	* What TODO items are left to do? 
	* Does it work on python on a normal machine? 
	* Does it work on the OLPC? Code quality and git commit history. 
	* Quality of the wiki entry at sugarlabs.org

## Running the Project
1. Download this repo (named Sugarizer)
2. In your browser (ex. Chrome) go to your extensions
3. Turn on developer mode
4. Click on the "Load unpacked extension..."
5. Choose the main folder of this repo and click OK
6. Sugarizer should show up as an extension
7. Click to launch Sugarizer

## Links
* [sugarlabs wiki link](https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Activities/Fractionator)

## Future Development
As of our final commits there are no outstanding bugs or to-do items. This project will run on any sugarizer-compatable machine. Two suggestions for additional features are
* Screen/display adjustemts for diffrent screen sizes/on resize
* Visual seperations of fractions on pie charts

To continue work or to pull from this project use the instructions under "Running the Project" to get the game running. Then you can make any changes or pull code from the Fractionators folder which is located within the Activities folder.

Our [final summary and presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nyYc2sGj486odVl5rGA07QVg53a8HjcfGCyW7PPMyXs/edit?usp=sharing) is also available.
